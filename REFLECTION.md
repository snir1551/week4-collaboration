- What was the most challenging Git concept this week?
	1. the most challenging concept was understanding the Rebase concept and when its best to use it and how exactly.


- What did you learn about collaboration? 
	1. we learned that we need to have good communication in order to not cause conflict by working on same files or branchs,
and also make the work faster and more efficient by allowing each of the collaborator to work on different feature.
	2. that we should create issue before creating a pull request.


- What mistakes did you make and how did you fix them? 
	1. we didnt pull the recent changes from main before trying to apply changes from new branchs, which made problems

	2. we accidently commited and pushed to the wrong branch, and we fixed it by using git reset --hard HEAD~1
